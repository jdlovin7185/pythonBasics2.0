# pythonBasics2.0

The purpose of this repository is for me to go over the basics of Python which I will eventually be certified in at an associate level.

I will then go from there and get certified in another thing related to Python if I do pass. The certification is through the company I work for. I am open to suggestions as I go through this journey
